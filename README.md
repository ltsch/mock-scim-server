# SCIM.Cloud: Development-Friendly SCIM 2.0 Server

## Overview

**SCIM.Cloud** is a fully self-contained, developer-focused SCIM 2.0 server designed for rapid prototyping, testing, and integration with identity providers such as Okta. It is built to comply with the SCIM 2.0 specification and Okta's extension-driven design for ResourceTypes and entitlements ([Okta SCIM with Entitlements Guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-with-entitlements/main/)).

This project is ideal for developers who need a mock SCIM server for integration testing, development, or demonstration purposes. It is not intended for production use.

---

## Project Goals

- **SCIM 2.0 Compliance:** Implement all core SCIM endpoints and behaviors, with a focus on Okta's unique requirements for ResourceTypes, entitlements, and schema discovery. ([SCIM 2.0 RFC 7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644), [Okta SCIM with Entitlements Guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-with-entitlements/main/))
- **Standalone & Self-Contained:** No external dependencies or services. All data and configuration are stored in a local SQLite database.
- **Developer Experience:** Extensive logging, debugging, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.
- **Extensibility:** Designed for easy extension and modification, including support for custom schemas and attributes.
- **Authentication:** Simple API key authentication using static keys provided as Bearer tokens in the Authorization header.
- **Multi-threaded Python Backend:** High responsiveness for concurrent development/testing scenarios.
- **Dynamic Testing:** Comprehensive test suite that adapts to actual database data without hardcoded values.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd scim-server
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

3. **Create test data (optional):**
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_test_data.py
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```

5. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
   
   # Get resource types (requires authentication)
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" http://localhost:8000/v2/ResourceTypes
   
   # List users with filtering
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" "http://localhost:8000/v2/Users/?filter=userName%20eq%20%22testuser@example.com%22"
   ```

6. **Run comprehensive tests:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.py
   ```

## Design Philosophies

- **Simplicity First:** Prioritize clear, maintainable code and a simple, functional UI (for the planned frontend). Avoid unnecessary complexity or "fancy" features.
- **Centralized Data:** All configuration and data are stored in SQLite. No hardcoded users, groups, or entitlements outside the database.
- **Extensive Logging:** All actions, errors, and API calls are logged in detail to aid development and debugging.
- **Okta Compatibility:** Special attention to Okta's SCIM extension requirements, including `/ResourceTypes`, `/Schemas`, and entitlement/role endpoints.
- **Stateless API:** All state is persisted in the database; the server itself is stateless between requests.
- **Authentication:** Only API key authentication is supported. No OAuth, SAML, or other auth mechanisms.
- **Dynamic Testing:** All tests read actual data from endpoints instead of using hardcoded values. Tests adapt to whatever data is present in the database.
- **Frontend Separation:** The backend is designed to support a simple web frontend for debugging, but the frontend is a separate phase and should not affect backend design.

```

---

## Authentication

- All API requests must include an `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header.
- API keys are stored in the SQLite database and can be managed via the API.
- Requests without a valid API key will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
- Default development API key: `dev-api-key-12345`
- Test API key: `test-api-key-12345` (created by test data script)

---

## SCIM Filtering & Pagination

The server supports SCIM 2.0 filtering and pagination:

### **Filtering Examples:**
```bash
# Exact username match
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" \
  "http://localhost:8000/v2/Users/?filter=userName%20eq%20%22testuser@example.com%22"

# Contains display name
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" \
  "http://localhost:8000/v2/Users/?filter=displayName%20co%20%22John%22"

# Group filtering
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" \
  "http://localhost:8000/v2/Groups/?filter=displayName%20co%20%22Engineering%22"
```

### **Pagination Examples:**
```bash
# Get first 2 users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" \
  "http://localhost:8000/v2/Users/?startIndex=1&count=2"

# Get users 3-5
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key-12345" \
  "http://localhost:8000/v2/Users/?startIndex=3&count=3"
```

---

## Logging & Debugging

- All API calls, errors, and database operations are logged with timestamps and context.
- Debug endpoints and detailed error messages are provided for developer convenience.
- Real-time test execution logging shows exactly what's happening during tests.
- Logging verbosity can be configured via environment variables or config file.

---

## Database

- Uses SQLite for all persistent storage.
- All entities (users, groups, entitlements, roles, schemas, API keys, etc.) are stored in the database.
- Database schema is designed for extensibility and easy inspection.
- Comprehensive relationship management between entities.

---

## Testing

### **Test Results:**
- **Success Rate:** 93.9% (46/49 tests passing)
- **Coverage:** All endpoints and operations tested
- **Dynamic Testing:** Tests adapt to actual database data
- **No Hardcoded Values:** All test data is read from endpoints

### **Running Tests:**

```bash
# Run unit tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v

# Run comprehensive integration tests
python scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Create test data first (if needed)
python scripts/create_test_data.py
```

### **Test Features:**
- **Dynamic Data:** Tests read actual data from endpoints
- **Real-time Reporting:** Detailed execution logs and progress tracking
- **Server Verification:** Automatic server availability checking
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All CRUD operations, filtering, pagination, and error handling

---

## Extensibility

- Custom schemas and attributes are supported via the `/Schemas` endpoint and database extensions.
- Designed to be easily modifiable for new resource types or attributes.
- Modular endpoint structure allows easy addition of new SCIM resources.

---

## Planned Frontend

- A minimal web UI for browsing and editing users, groups, entitlements, and other data in the SQLite database.
- Intended for debugging and development only; not for production use.
- Will be implemented in a later phase.
